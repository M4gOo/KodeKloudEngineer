======================Ansible Basic Playbook =====================================

One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working on to test an Ansible playbook on jump host. However, he was only able to create the inventory.
Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ls -al inventory 
-rw-r--r-- 1 thor thor 54 Jul 30 12:30 inventory

file /home/thor/ansible/inventory seems to be having some issues, please fix them. The playbook needs to be run on App Server 3 in Stratos DC, so inventory file needs to be updated accordingly.
Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and add a task to create an empty file /tmp/file.txt on App Server 3

vi /home/thor/ansible/inventory      (This file was already there)
stapp02 ansible_host=172.238.16.204 ansible_user=steve

after changes (need to add the password, otherwise it wont work - this is not a good practice)
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_pass=xxxx

#### Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml
- name: Create a file in app03
  hosts: stapp03
  tasks:
   - name: Create an empty file
     ansible.builtin.file:
      path: /tmp/file.txt
      state: touch

ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml



=============================Ansible Inventory Update=========================================

DevOps team has started testing their Ansible playbooks on different servers within the stack.
some playbooks under /home/thor/playbook/
now they want to test them on app server 3 in Stratos DC. However, they first need to create an inventory file so that Ansible can connect to the respective app

Create an ini type Ansible inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory on jump host    (GOOD PRACTICE TO USE .INI), but can be anything. In this case I used without .ini
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_pass=xxxx

thor@jump_host ~/playbook$ ls
ansible.cfg  inventory  playbook.yml



========================== Ansible Config File Update ================================================ /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

To manage all servers within the stack using Ansible, the Nautilus DevOps team is planning to use a common sudo user among all servers. 
Ansible will be able to use this to perform different tasks on each server

on jump host make appropriate changes so that Ansible can use mariyam as a default ssh user for all hosts. Make changes in Ansible's default configuration only

vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
...
# default user to use for playbooks if user is not specified
# (/usr/bin/ansible will use current user as default)
#remote_user = root    (CHANGE HERE)   
...

# default user to use for playbooks if user is not specified
# (/usr/bin/ansible will use current user as default)
remote_user = mariyam



================= Ansible Copy Module ==================================================

There is data on jump host that needs to be copied on all application servers in Stratos DC

On jump host create an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory and add all application servers as managed nodes.
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=xxxx
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_pass=xx
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_pass=xxx

On jump host create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml to copy /usr/src/devops/index.html file to all application servers at location /opt/devops

(THIS GIVES ME AN ERROR!!!!)
- name: Copy file on jump host to all app servers 
  hosts: all
  ansible.builtin.copy:
    src: /usr/src/devops/index.html
    dest: /opt/devops

(DO THIS!!!)
- name: Copy file on jump host to all app servers
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: copy index.html to /opt/security 
    copy: src=/usr/src/security/index.html dest=/opt/security

stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n
