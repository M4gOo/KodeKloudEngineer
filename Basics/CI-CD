CI (continuous integration) is the practice of integrating code changes into a repository multiple times a day.

CD has two meanings: (continuous delivery / deployment)
continuous delivery automates code integrations.
continuous deployment automatically releases final builds to end users. 

CI/CD testing reduces errors and code defects, making it essential for every DevOps workflow
