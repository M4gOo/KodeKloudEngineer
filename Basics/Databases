what is database?
-it's a collection of data 
-contains a method for accessing and manipulating that data.

For our application to be able to do things like update somebody's username in the database or edit their profile photo or delete a user, whatever it is, there's
a database management system that allows us to interface with that database.

when people talk about a database, you actually hear them referring to both of these things, the database management system and the database together just as a database.

PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle SQL Light. They're not technically databases, they're actually database management systems.


================================ SQL vc MySQL ======================================

SQL which stands for Structured Query Language
SQL is the language that we use when we talk to our databases.
It's the way that we interact and access the data, update data, delete things and basically manipulate the data in our databases.
MySQL is a DBMS

====================================================================================

what makes databases or database management systems, to be specific, what makes them unique are the features that they offer. Not the sequel or the language itself.
you might write the same line of code to do the same thing.
So what makes these different are the features that they implement, things like 
how secure is one versus the other? 
how how fast is it?
How much?
How big is the download?
How do user permissions work?

================================== install in linux (ubuntu)
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo service mysql status

The network status of the MySQL service 
sudo ss -tap | grep mysql

=============================================================

we can have multiple databases within a MySQL database server.

A database (RELATIONAL) is really just a bunch of tables.
Tables are what we need to put in those databases so that we can hold data.
They describe the format and the shape of our data, and then they hold collections of data that follows that shape.

tables are data types
we define the structure of a table, we're not only saying what column names we want, but we also specify the types, what type of information is permitted in each column. 
This avoid problem like one user insert number and another a text as a content in a column, this might cause some problem 

varchar - 'something' . We can specify the number of characters varchar(100)
int - 4398

========================== NULL columm ====================
means is that the null value is permitted in this particular column in name and in age, for example

NULL is a value in my SQL that means no value. It represents the lack of a value for a given row. It basically means if we see null set to yes, that name can be empty for a row or age can be empty,
or in fact both could be missing entirely.

it's really important to know this is different than something like zero.
Zero is a number. It is a value.
NULL means that there is no information, there is no value at all.


===========================  CRUD in MySQL ============================
It stands for for things C, R, U, and D, create, read, update and delete.
And they are the four basic actions that we want to be able to do to our data.

We can create individual rows using insert

R and CRUD, which is read. How do we retrieve or read data that's already in a table?
We use select.

where is not limited to working with select, we will be using where to make updates or to delete rows as well.

We certainly insert and select more more often than updating
Whether we have some website and restoring user information, a user changes their password or they
change their username, or we alter some existing order, something in a shopping cart item to get added or removed.
Things are dynamic. We use an update query.

D for deletion, destroy. delete rows from a table in SQL, use delete from and then some table name.
