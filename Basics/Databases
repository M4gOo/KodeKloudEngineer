what is database?
-it's a collection of data 
-contains a method for accessing and manipulating that data.

For our application to be able to do things like update somebody's username in the database or edit their profile photo or delete a user, whatever it is, there's
a database management system that allows us to interface with that database.

when people talk about a database, you actually hear them referring to both of these things, the database management system and the database together just as a database.

PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle SQL Light. They're not technically databases, they're actually database management systems.


================================ SQL vc MySQL ======================================

SQL which stands for Structured Query Language
SQL is the language that we use when we talk to our databases.
It's the way that we interact and access the data, update data, delete things and basically manipulate the data in our databases.
MySQL is a DBMS

====================================================================================

what makes databases or database management systems, to be specific, what makes them unique are the features that they offer. Not the sequel or the language itself.
you might write the same line of code to do the same thing.
So what makes these different are the features that they implement, things like 
how secure is one versus the other? 
how how fast is it?
How much?
How big is the download?
How do user permissions work?
