=========================== LINUX ============================================

installed a backup agent tool on all app servers. As per the tool's requirements they need to create a user with a non-interactive shell.

sudo adduser kareem -s /sbin/nologin

why have a non-interactive shell?
a non-interactive shell is a type of shell that doesn't interact with the user. We can run it through a script or similar. Also, it can be run through some automated process.


edit limits, nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. 
vi /etc/security/limits.conf
nfsuser         soft    nproc           1024
nfsuser         hard    nproc           2027


========================== GIT ==========================
 create a bare repository /opt/demo.git 
 sudo git init --bare /opt/demo.git

sudo git add index.html
sudo git commit -m "add index.html"
sudo git push -u origin master

git branch --list
